# Unexpected Behavior in React Router DOM with Nested Routes or Route Parameters

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router DOM v6 related to nested routes and route parameters. The issue manifests as unexpected rendering or navigation behavior, which may not be immediately apparent.

## Problem Description
The provided example shows a scenario where nested routes or routes with parameters fail to render correctly or cause unexpected navigation issues. The exact behavior may vary depending on the specific structure of your routes and the way you are using route parameters.  This is often caused by incorrect route definitions, missing `<Outlet>` components within parent routes, or incorrect parameter handling within route components.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Navigate to different routes and observe the unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the route definitions to correct any errors in nesting or parameter handling.  Make sure to correctly use the `<Outlet>` component to render child routes within parent routes.  Also, thoroughly check parameter handling within component functions to ensure correct data access and usage.
